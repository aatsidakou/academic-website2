I am a second year Phd student at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by **Constantine Caramanis** and **Sujay Sanghavi**. I received my BSE from the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens. After receiving my BSE I worked for a year at NCSR “Demokritos”, in the Complex Event Recognition Group.
